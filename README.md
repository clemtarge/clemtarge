## FastML
FastML allows you to *create*, *train*, *test*, and *save* your Machine Learning model with two lines of code.  
You can also *optimize* it with **Bayesian Optimization** by specifying model hyperparameters.

## Preprocessing (Python notebook)
In this notebook, you will find some functions to *visualize*, *transform* and *replace NaN values* in the data.


## Non parametric statistical tests (R notebook)
In this notebook, you will find some statistical tests to test:

* Adequation to a distribution
    * Kolmogorov test
    * Chi2 test
* Adequation to a normal distribution
    * Shapiro-Wilk test
    * Lilliefors test
    * Other methods
* Homogeneity between two samples
    * Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
    * Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
    * Chi2 test
* Independance between two samples
    * Chi2 test
