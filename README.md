## FastML
FastML allows you to *create*, *train*, *test*, and *save* your Machine Learning model with two lines of code.  
You can also *optimize* it with **Bayesian Optimization** by specifying model hyperparameters.

## Reinforcement learning
Some codes to use Q-Learning or Actor-Critic agent in Pytorch. Actor-Critic is also available in Tensorflow 2.  
The notebooks can be used as examples or as starting points.


## Preprocessing (Python notebook)
In this notebook, you will find some functions to *visualize*, *transform* and *replace NaN values* in the data.

## Preprocessing time series (Python notebook)
Some useful functions to deal with time series. Download `climate/` for toydata.  

## Statistical tests (R notebook)
In this notebook, you will find some non parametric statistical tests to test:

* Adequation to a distribution
    * Kolmogorov test
    * Chi2 test
* Adequation to a normal distribution
    * Shapiro-Wilk test
    * Lilliefors test
    * Other methods
* Homogeneity between two samples
    * Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
    * Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
    * Chi2 test
* Independance between two samples
    * Chi2 test
